My very first porfolio built with React.js
# Getting Started with Create React App


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

To publish websites to github pages
